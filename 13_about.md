## Goal

Thousands of lifesaving organs are wasted every year. Our goal is to highlight underlying causes that can be addressed. We investigated and analyzed the current organ donation system, looking specifically at common practices by OPOs, technology managed by government contractors, and the governance structure within the organ donation system. These reports outline what we found, and what recommendations we have for improving the system. 


## Methodology 

[Bloom Works](https://bloomworks.digital/) interviewed more than 30 people within the organ donation system, including the following: 


*   Organ procurement organization leaders and staff
*   Organ specialist consultants
*   Donor hospital staff
*   Transplant surgeons
*   Government officials
*   Tech entrepreneurs interested in offering solutions in this space
*   Researchers 

Our reports are based on those interviews, case studies, and published research. 


##  Timeline

Bloom began the discovery sprint in July, 2020 and finalized the reports and recommendations in October, 2020. 


## Team members 

Bloomâ€™s research is supported by Arnold Ventures and Schmidt Futures in partnership with Organize and the Federation of American Scientists.
